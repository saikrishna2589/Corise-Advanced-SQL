/*
I created customers_CTE  that joins the customer data table with the customer address table and resources table to get the
customer info along with geospatial details.
Another CTE is of supplier ' supplier_state_cte' joining supplier details with the resources table to obtain the geospatial details.
Third CTE is a table called 'distance' that cross joins each row of customer_cte with supplier_state_cte to get all combinations of customer and supplier geospatial rows.
From this finally, I did a subquery with inner join between the 'distance table' and 'closest table,which gets the 'minimum' distance to get the final view.
This view provides closest distance from each customer to the nearest supplier.
