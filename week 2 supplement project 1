-- Introduced meaningful CTE names: The CTEs in the final version have more descriptive names, such as recipe_ingredients, ingredient_nutrition, and recipe_nutrition. This improves code readability and makes it easier to understand the purpose of each CTE.

-- Simplified subqueries: Instead of nesting multiple subqueries, I used CTEs to break down the logic into separate sections. This improves code structure, makes it easier to read, and allows for better maintainability.

-- Removed unnecessary columns: The ingredient column from the recipe_nutrition CTE was removed since it is not used in the final SELECT statement. This eliminates ambiguity and improves code clarity.

-- Updated GROUP BY clause: In the final SELECT statement, the GROUP BY clause now only includes the recipe_name column. This ensures that the grouping is done correctly and aligns with the original code's output.

-- Adjusted JOIN condition: The JOIN condition between the recipe_nutrition CTE and vk_data.resources.nutrition was modified to match on first_record instead of di.first_record. This ensures the correct association between the recipe and its corresponding nutritional information.
